    <div class="panel">
        <h1>Here's some interesting questions to ask</h1>
        <p>Click the buttons to generate new questions!</p>
        <p>These questions are meant to be used on a date, but they can be used for any situation. 
            They are organized by color, and each color has a different level of depth.</p>
        <p>Blue questions are miscelaneous questions that didn't really fit in with the other color questions.</p>
        <p>Green questions are surface level questions that are easy to answer.</p>
        <p>Yellow questions are a little more in depth and require a little more thought.</p>
        <p>Red questions are pretty personal and can be a little awkward to answer.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="panel">
        <p>Here's the live number of questions available in each color:</p>

        <div id="color-counts">
            <div id="blue-count"></div>
            <div id="green-count"></div>
            <div id="yellow-count"></div>
            <div id="red-count"></div>
        </div>

        <p>Please lmk if you find any interesting questions you think would be good to add! 
            Eventually I want to add a box where new questions can be submitted, but sending 
            data <em>to</em> the site requires me to learn some more complicated stuff I don't
            have the time to look into right now. Eventually I will though! (maybe) ((prolly not))</p>
